# HarperDB StackPath Guide

Simple project to demonstrate getting HarperDB running on StackPath Workload Containers. In this guide, I go through setting up StackPath for the first time and running a simple test HarperDB Instance on a Workload Container.

To act as the test project, I am going to use a simple movie quotes database to serve all or a single movie quote using HarperDB's Custom Functions (via [Time Travel Movie Club](https://github.com/wcmbishop/time-travel-movie-club)).
